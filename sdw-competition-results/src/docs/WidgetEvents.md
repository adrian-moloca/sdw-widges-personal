# üì° Widget Event Callbacks

The widget supports several lifecycle and user interaction event callbacks. These allow the parent application to track user actions, trigger behaviors, and capture analytics.

## ‚úÖ How to Use

To set up event handling, pass an `onClick*` or `onEvent` callback function as part of the `config` prop when initializing the widget:

```tsx
<Widget
  config={{
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    onClickTeam: (event, payload) => {
      console.log('Team clicked:', payload);
    },
    onEvent: (event, payload) => {
      console.log('Event triggered:', event, payload);
    },
  }}
/>
```
